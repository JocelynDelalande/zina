* Fri, 30 Sep 2011:
  - When adding a new directory to the database, Zina would try and fetch the
    title for that directory from the ID3 tag of an mp3 contained in that
    directory. Specifically, it would only use the 'album' tag of the file, so
    the name of the artist would be lost, which I consider confusing and ugly.
    The code that is responsible for this fetch is now commented out, so that
    new directories are always added to the database by their full name.
  - Made all files non-executable.
  - Added a 'doc' directory, containing just the old changelog from
    http://www.pancake.org/zina/changelog/2 for now

  - Imported Zina version 2.0b22.
  - Fix a bug where the existing playlist of the flash player (Zinamp) would be
    deleted upon adding a new song. See
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/zina/forums/forum/281819/topic/4584404
    for more information.
